</p>

<br>

In this challenge, you'll be using JavaScript to filter out jobs based on selected categories. We provide a local JSON file to help you practice working with JSON data.
<br>
Your users should be able to:
<br>
* Filter job listings based on the categories selected.
* View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
